Yarnstring
==========

Yarnstring library and extension for threaded comments.

Copyright 2014 George Kormaris

**Yarnstring** is a more intuitive way to display threaded comments.

For now it works as an extension for Chrome and reddit comments. [Get it here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yarnstring/oladfdlaecfccccppmgegnoeanabaefe).

It will soon be available as a standalone library as well as a browser extension for Disqus and YCombinator comment threads.
